#TapTap

##What is it?
It is a simple clicker game. When the color name and color on the screen matches you click it!

##Who can play it?
Everyone! But it's more *interesting and useful* for children or grown-ups who are only learning colors.

##Can I play it on my phone or tablet?
Sure! It's a progressive web app, so you can add it to your home-screen and play it at any time.

##Do I need Internet connection to play it?
No! It caches all important files when you open it, so even when you're not connected to the network you can play this great game.

##Who is the author?
Originally it's a mobile game created by [CrazyAlarmClock](https://github.com/CrazyAlarmClock). But it was improved by me, **Michas**. New animation, better engine that doesn't allow same colors to appear consistently (if previous color was red, it will not appear again), minimum memory required.
